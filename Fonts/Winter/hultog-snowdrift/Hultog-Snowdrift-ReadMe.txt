HULTOG SNOWDRIFT
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

While mentally cataloguing the font-variant clichés I haven’t explored yet (there are only a few left!) it occurred to me that I’ve never dabbled in the “snow-top” genre, despite being happily obsessed with all things wintry. So, I dove into it enthusiastically, playing with rough clumps of snow, smooth drifts of snow, piled-high stacks of snow and so on. This is one of the more useful of the early experiments, a new Hultog variant (all-caps, but otherwise a full-keyboard set).
